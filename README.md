# HelpR

This repository is a collection of standalone snippets of R code relevant to typical data importation, transformation, and visualization use cases.

It is meant as a reference for the novice-to-intermediate data scientist to adapt code to their project without resorting to time-consuming online search.

Each snippet typically offers at least three syntaxes for each use case: a base R version, a Tidyverse version, and a data.table version, plus an occasional variant using a fit-for-purpose package, to suit every user's preferences and performance requirements.

The code is not optimized for brevity, as in code golf. The code is instead optimized for readability.

You are welcome to submit pull requests that enhance existing snippets or add new ones.
